To-change list based on V2:
-D2,D3 pads are reversed
-C13 wrong size. Likely due to buying incorrect part
-Camera slot need moving towards Pi GPIO (inwards) by 1.5mm
-Servo out pins move to fully inboard
-Pi power switch labels need to be reversed
-More the power switches fully inboard
-Remove Polulu pins  DONE
-Don't use staking headers (it'll be the top board anyway, due to the extra height needed for the Kakute)
