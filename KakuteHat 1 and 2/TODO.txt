Todo for V2 Kakute schematic:
-Use non-rescue symbols
-Power GPIO's are possibly suboptimal. maybe just use closer ones
-I2C connections to Kakute and GPS2
-Go over to Seed OPL parts library
-Use Seed BoM Tool
-Use correct Pi power GPIO pins
-Maybe put the Power module under the Kakute
-Fix rotation of RC plug
-Move camera slot slightly
-Swap EEPROM SDA and SCL to correct
-Power switch for Flight Controller
-External switches via JST-GH 6-pin connector
-Move Power switch(es) to edge
